# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on various demographic and health-related factors using machine learning techniques. The project employs a systematic approach that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling to derive actionable insights and accurate predictions.

**Key Features:**
<br/>
**Data Analysis:** Comprehensive exploration of the insurance.csv dataset to identify trends, correlations, and outliers.
<br/>
**Data Preprocessing:** Implementation of essential steps such as encoding categorical variables and feature scaling.
<br/>
**Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes Linear Regression to predict insurance costs & Evaluation of model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ².<br/>
**Visualization:** Use of Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations for better understanding of the data.<br/>

**Libraries Used:**
<br/>Data Manipulation: Pandas, Numpy
<br/>
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
<br/>
Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn

**How to Use:**
- Clone the repository and install required dependencies.
