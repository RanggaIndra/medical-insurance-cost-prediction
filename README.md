**Medical Insurance Cost Prediction**
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on various demographic and health-related factors using machine learning techniques. The project employs a systematic approach that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling to derive actionable insights and accurate predictions.

**Key Features:**
Data Analysis: Comprehensive exploration of the insurance.csv dataset to identify trends, correlations, and outliers.
Data Preprocessing: Implementation of essential steps such as encoding categorical variables and feature scaling.
Machine Learning Model:
- Utilizes Linear Regression to predict insurance costs.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ².
Visualization: Use of Seaborn and Matplotlib to create insightful visualizations for better understanding of the data.

**Libraries Used:**
Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn

**How to Use:**
Clone the repository and install required dependencies.
Place the insurance.csv file in the root directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook to replicate results or modify it for experimentation.
This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning, showcasing the capability to solve real-world problems in the insurance domain.
